## Flask Views

The provided code defines various Flask routes (views) for different pages of a web application. It imports necessary modules, including models for database operations, and uses Flask's `Blueprint` to create a modular blueprint for the views.

### Code Explanation:

1. Import necessary modules and packages.
2. Create a Flask blueprint named `views` with the URL prefix of `'/'`.
3. Define route handlers for different pages:
   - `/login`: Renders the login page template (`login/login.html`).
   - `/dashboard`: Fetches all products from the database and renders the dashboard page template (`dashboard/dashboard.html`) with the product data and the user ID stored in the session.
   - `/profile`: Retrieves user information, orders, tickets, and addresses from the database based on the provided user ID query parameter. Renders the profile page template (`profile/profile.html`) with the fetched data and the user ID stored in the session.
   - `/order`: Retrieves product information and addresses from the database based on the provided product ID query parameter. Renders the order page template (`order/order.html`) with the product and address data and the user ID stored in the session.
   - `/help`: Renders the help page template (`help/help.html`) with the user ID stored in the session.
   - `/editor`: Renders the editor page template (`editor/editor.html`).
4. Each route handler is decorated with `@cross_origin()` to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the corresponding route.
5. Exception handling is implemented in each route to return JSON responses with error details if any exception occurs.
6. The code demonstrates how to define Flask routes, retrieve data from the database, and render templates with the fetched data.

This code provides the basic routing logic for different pages of a web application, allowing users to access login, dashboard, profile, order, help, and editor pages.
